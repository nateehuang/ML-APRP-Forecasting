    There are some dataframes that include Open/High/Low/Close/Adj Close/etc. 
    In time series analysis, we only need one line of prices for each ticker. 
    This function is to obtain that one line of prices from different merging
    rule. 

    What's more, vwap/twap are much more used on the trading and short 
    investment strategies side than on investment and wealth management 
    side (which requires a medium and long term for both investing and 
    for forecasting). In most cases we rely on closing daily prices when 
    available; for a few asset classes we may only have weekly, monthly, 
    or even quarterly.
